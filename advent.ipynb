    "You and The Historians look a lot more pixelated than you remember. You're inside a computer at the North Pole!\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as you're about to check out your surroundings, a program runs up to you. \"This region of memory isn't safe! The User misunderstood what a pushdown automaton is and their algorithm is pushing whole bytes down on top of us! Run!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is fast - it's going to cause a byte to fall into your memory space once every nanosecond! Fortunately, you're faster, and by quickly scanning the algorithm, you create a list of which bytes will fall (your puzzle input) in the order they'll land in your memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your memory space is a two-dimensional grid with coordinates that range from 0 to 70 both horizontally and vertically. However, for the sake of example, suppose you're on a smaller grid with coordinates that range from 0 to 6 and the following list of incoming byte positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "Each byte position is given as an X,Y coordinate, where X is the distance from the left edge of your memory space and Y is the distance from the top edge of your memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "You and The Historians are currently in the top left corner of the memory space (at 0,0) and need to reach the exit in the bottom right corner (at 70,70 in your memory space, but at 6,6 in this example). You'll need to simulate the falling bytes to plan out where it will be safe to run; for now, simulate just the first few bytes falling into your memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "As bytes fall into your memory space, they make that coordinate corrupted. Corrupted memory coordinates cannot be entered by you or The Historians, so you'll need to plan your route carefully. You also cannot leave the boundaries of the memory space; your only hope is to reach the exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, if you were to draw the memory space after the first 12 bytes have fallen (using . for safe and # for corrupted), it would look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "The Historians push the button on their strange device, but this time, you all just feel like you're falling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Situation critical\", the device announces in a familiar voice. \"Bootstrapping process failed. Initializing debugger....\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The small handheld device suddenly unfolds into an entire computer! The Historians look around nervously before one of them tosses it to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems to be a 3-bit computer: its program is a list of 3-bit numbers (0 through 7), like 0,1,2,3. The computer also has three registers named A, B, and C, but these registers aren't limited to 3 bits and can instead hold any integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computer knows eight instructions, each identified by a 3-bit number (called the instruction's opcode). Each instruction also reads the 3-bit number after it as an input; this is called its operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number called the instruction pointer identifies the position in the program from which the next opcode will be read; it starts at 0, pointing at the first 3-bit number in the program. Except for jump instructions, the instruction pointer increases by 2 after each instruction is processed (to move past the instruction's opcode and its operand). If the computer tries to read an opcode past the end of the program, it instead halts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the program 0,1,2,3 would run the instruction whose opcode is 0 and pass it the operand 1, then run the instruction having opcode 2 and pass it the operand 3, then halt.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of operands; each instruction specifies the type of its operand. The value of a literal operand is the operand itself. For example, the value of the literal operand 7 is the number 7. The value of a combo operand can be found as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Combo operands 0 through 3 represent literal values 0 through 3.\n",
    "Combo operand 4 represents the value of register A.\n",
    "Combo operand 5 represents the value of register B.\n",
    "Combo operand 6 represents the value of register C.\n",
    "Combo operand 7 is reserved and will not appear in valid programs.\n",
    "The eight instructions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The adv instruction (opcode 0) performs division. The numerator is the value in the A register. The denominator is found by raising 2 to the power of the instruction's combo operand. (So, an operand of 2 would divide A by 4 (2^2); an operand of 5 would divide A by 2^B.) The result of the division operation is truncated to an integer and then written to the A register.\n",
    "\n",

    "To get The Historian safely to the bathroom, you'll need a way to predict where the robots will be in the future. Fortunately, they all seem to be moving on the tile floor in predictable straight lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "You make a list (your puzzle input) of all of the robots' current positions (p) and velocities (v), one robot per line. For example:\n",

    "Each robot's velocity is given as v=x,y where x and y are given in tiles per second. Positive x means the robot is moving to the right, and positive y means the robot is moving down. So, a velocity of v=1,-2 means that each second, the robot moves 1 tile to the right and 2 tiles up.\n",

    "The robots are good at navigating over/under each other (due to a combination of springs, extendable legs, and quadcopters), so they can share the same tile and don't interact with each other. Visually, the number of robots on each tile in this example looks like this:\n",

    "These robots have a unique feature for maximum bathroom security: they can teleport. When a robot would run into an edge of the space they're in, they instead teleport to the other side, effectively wrapping around the edges. Here is what robot p=2,4 v=2,-3 does for the first few seconds:\n",

    "\n",
    "Next up: the lobby of a resort on a tropical island. The Historians take a moment to admire the hexagonal floor tiles before spreading out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, it looks like the resort has a new arcade! Maybe you can win some prizes from the claw machines?\n",
    "\n",
    "The claw machines here are a little unusual. Instead of a joystick or directional buttons to control the claw, these machines have two buttons labeled A and B. Worse, you can't just put in a token and play; it costs 3 tokens to push the A button and 1 token to push the B button.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a little experimentation, you figure out that each machine's buttons are configured to move the claw a specific amount to the right (along the X axis) and a specific amount forward (along the Y axis) each time that button is pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each machine contains one prize; to win the prize, the claw must be positioned exactly above the prize on both the X and Y axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You wonder: what is the smallest number of tokens you would have to spend to win as many prizes as possible? You assemble a list of every machine's button behavior and prize location (your puzzle input). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Button A: X+94, Y+34\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This list describes the button configuration and prize location of four different claw machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, consider just the first claw machine in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pushing the machine's A button would move the claw 94 units along the X axis and 34 units along the Y axis.\n",
    "Pushing the B button would move the claw 22 units along the X axis and 67 units along the Y axis.\n",
    "The prize is located at X=8400, Y=5400; this means that from the claw's initial position, it would need to move exactly 8400 units along the X axis and exactly 5400 units along the Y axis to be perfectly aligned with the prize in this machine.\n",
    "The cheapest way to win the prize is by pushing the A button 80 times and the B button 40 times. This would line up the claw along the X axis (because 80*94 + 40*22 = 8400) and along the Y axis (because 80*34 + 40*67 = 5400). Doing this would cost 80*3 tokens for the A presses and 40*1 for the B presses, a total of 280 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second and fourth claw machines, there is no combination of A and B presses that will ever win a prize.\n",
    "\n",

Be especially careful when counting the fence around regions like the one full of type A plants; in particular, each section of fence has an in-side and an out-side, so the fence does not connect across the middle of the region (where the two B regions touch diagonally).

    "\n",
    "The ancient civilization on Pluto was known for its ability to manipulate spacetime, and while The Historians explore their infinite corridors, you've noticed a strange set of physics-defying stones.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, they seem like normal stones: they're arranged in a perfectly straight line, and each stone has a number engraved on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strange part is that every time you blink, the stones change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the number engraved on a stone changes. Other times, a stone might split in two, causing all the other stones to shift over a bit to make room in their perfectly straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you observe them for a while, you find that the stones have a consistent behavior. Every time you blink, the stones each simultaneously change according to the first applicable rule in this list:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the stone is engraved with the number 0, it is replaced by a stone engraved with the number 1.\n",
    "If the stone is engraved with a number that has an even number of digits, it is replaced by two stones. The left half of the digits are engraved on the new left stone, and the right half of the digits are engraved on the new right stone. (The new numbers don't keep extra leading zeroes: 1000 would become stones 10 and 0.)\n",
    "If none of the other rules apply, the stone is replaced by a new stone; the old stone's number multiplied by 2024 is engraved on the new stone.\n",
    "No matter how the stones change, their order is preserved, and they stay on their perfectly straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "How will the stones evolve if you keep blinking at them? You take a note of the number engraved on each stone in the line (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have an arrangement of five stones engraved with the numbers 0 1 10 99 999 and you blink once, the stones transform as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stone, 0, becomes a stone marked 1.\n",
    "The second stone, 1, is multiplied by 2024 to become 2024.\n",
    "The third stone, 10, is split into a stone marked 1 followed by a stone marked 0.\n",
    "The fourth stone, 99, is split into two stones marked 9.\n",
    "The fifth stone, 999, is replaced by a stone marked 2021976.\n",
    "So, after blinking once, your five stones would become an arrangement of seven stones engraved with the numbers 1 2024 1 0 9 9 2021976.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a longer example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Initial arrangement:\n",
    "125 17\n",
